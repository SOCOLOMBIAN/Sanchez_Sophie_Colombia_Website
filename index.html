        <h2> History of Colombia</h2>
        <p>Colombia's history is rich and diverse, shaped by its indigenous cultures, Spanish colonization, and the struggle for independence.</p>
        <p>Before the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century, the region was inhabited by various indigenous groups, including the Muisca, Tairona, and Quimbaya, each with their own unique cultures and societies.</p>
        <p>In 1499, Spanish explorer Alonso de Ojeda arrived on the northern coast, marking the beginning of European influence. The Spanish established settlements, including Bogotá in 1538, and the region became part of the Viceroyalty of Peru and later the Viceroyalty of New Granada.</p>
        <p>The fight for independence began in the early 19th century, with leaders like Simón Bolívar playing a crucial role. Colombia finally gained independence from Spain in 1819, but the new nation faced internal conflicts, leading to periods of civil war and fragmentation.</p>
        <p>In 1903, Panama separated from Colombia, a significant loss for the country. The 20th century was marked by political violence, notably the La Violencia period (1948-1958), which resulted in significant social upheaval.</p>
        <p>Despite challenges, Colombia has made strides in recent decades, moving towards stability and economic growth. Today, it is known for its vibrant culture, biodiversity, and rich history, attracting tourists from around the world.</p>
